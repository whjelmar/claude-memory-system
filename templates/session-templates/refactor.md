# Refactoring Session: [DATE TIME]

## Refactoring Objective
- **Target Area**: [Component/Module/Pattern being refactored]
- **Motivation**: [Why is this refactoring needed?]
- **Risk Level**: [Low / Medium / High]

## Current State Analysis

### Problems with Current Code
<!-- What's wrong with the current implementation? -->
- [ ] Problem 1: [description]
- [ ] Problem 2: [description]

### Code Smells Identified
- [ ] Duplication in...
- [ ] Long method in...
- [ ] God class...
- [ ] Tight coupling between...

### Technical Debt
<!-- What debt is being addressed? -->


## Refactoring Plan

### Desired End State
<!-- What should the code look like after? -->


### Approach
<!-- What refactoring techniques will you use? -->
- [ ] Extract method/class
- [ ] Move functionality
- [ ] Rename for clarity
- [ ] Introduce abstraction
- [ ] Remove duplication
- [ ] Other: [specify]

### Files to Touch
| File | Changes | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | [changes] | Low/Med/High |

### Order of Operations
1. [ ] First, do this (safe)
2. [ ] Then, do this (depends on 1)
3. [ ] Finally, do this (cleanup)

## Progress This Session

### Changes Made
- [ ] `path/to/file.ts` - [what changed]

### Tests Status
- [ ] All existing tests passing
- [ ] New tests added for refactored code
- [ ] Coverage maintained/improved

## Safety Checklist
<!-- Ensure refactoring doesn't break anything -->
- [ ] All tests pass before starting
- [ ] Working in small, tested increments
- [ ] Each commit is atomic and reversible
- [ ] No behavior changes (unless intended)
- [ ] All tests pass after each change
- [ ] Code review requested

## Before/After Examples

### Before
```typescript
// Old code
```

### After
```typescript
// New code
```

## Session Checklist
- [ ] Scope clearly defined
- [ ] Tests passing before changes
- [ ] Refactoring completed incrementally
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Code is cleaner/better organized
- [ ] Tests still passing
- [ ] Performance not degraded

## Decisions Made
<!-- Document any decisions about how to refactor -->
- Decision:
- Trade-offs:

## Metrics (if applicable)
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Lines of code | | |
| Complexity | | |
| Test coverage | | |
| Performance | | |

## Notes
<!-- Observations, learnings, things to watch -->


## Next Steps
<!-- If refactoring spans multiple sessions -->
- [ ] Continue with...
- [ ] Additional refactoring needed in...
